# Multi-User System Implementation

## Changes Made

The Subscription Tracker has been converted from a single-user to a multi-user system with role-based access control.

### Key Features

1. **User Roles**:
   - **Standard Users**: Can only manage their own subscriptions and settings
   - **Admin Users**: Can manage all users, create new users, and access admin settings

2. **User Management**:
   - Registration is disabled for public users
   - Only admins can create new users
   - Admins can modify user roles, passwords, and delete users (with restrictions)

3. **Security**:
   - Admins cannot delete themselves while logged in
   - There must always be at least one admin user
   - The last admin cannot have their admin role removed

### Implementation Details

#### Database Changes
- User model already had `is_admin` field
- Added cascade delete relationships for UserSettings and Subscriptions
- Each user has isolated subscriptions and settings

#### Routes Added
- `/admin/users` - List all users (admin only)
- `/admin/users/add` - Add new user (admin only)
- `/admin/users/edit/<id>` - Edit user (admin only)
- `/admin/users/delete/<id>` - Delete user (admin only)

#### Templates Added
- `admin_users.html` - User management dashboard
- `admin_add_user.html` - Add user form
- `admin_edit_user.html` - Edit user form

#### Forms Added
- `AdminUserForm` - For creating new users
- `AdminEditUserForm` - For editing existing users

#### Navigation Changes
- Removed registration link from login page
- Added "Admin Settings" menu item for admin users
- Admin settings accessible via Settings dropdown

### Admin User Creation

The system automatically creates a default admin user if no admin exists:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `changeme`
- This only happens if there are no existing admin users

### User Isolation

- Each user has their own subscriptions and settings
- Users cannot access other users' data
- All existing functionality (dashboard, analytics, etc.) works per-user
- Currency conversion, notifications, and other features work independently per user

### Admin Capabilities

Admin users can:
- View all users in the system
- Create new users (both standard and admin)
- Edit user details (username, email, password, role)
- Delete users (with restrictions)
- See user statistics (subscription counts)

### Restrictions

- Admins cannot delete themselves while logged in
- Cannot delete the last admin user
- Cannot remove admin role from the last admin
- Deleting a user also deletes all their subscriptions and settings

### Migration Notes

- Existing users will retain their data
- If upgrading from single-user, the existing admin user will remain as admin
- No data migration needed - all existing subscriptions belong to existing users

### Security Considerations

- All admin routes check for admin privileges
- User isolation is enforced at the database query level
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- Form validation prevents privilege escalation

This implementation provides a clean separation between users while maintaining the existing functionality for each individual user.
